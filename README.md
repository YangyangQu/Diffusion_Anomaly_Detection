# Anomaly Detection with Diffusion and Probability Estimation

This repository presents an innovative approach to anomaly detection by integrating diffusion processes with probability estimation. The core methodology involves computing the likelihood using a probability flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) coupled with the application of the Skilling-Hutchinson trace estimator.

## Key Concepts

- **Diffusion Processes**: Utilized to model the distribution of data points in a high-dimensional space, aiding in identifying outliers.
- **Probability Flow ODE**: A novel technique to compute the likelihood of data points, facilitating the detection of anomalies.
- **Skilling-Hutchinson Trace Estimator**: Employed to efficiently estimate the trace of large matrices, which is crucial in high-dimensional probability estimation.

## Application

The techniques developed here are applied to various datasets to demonstrate their effectiveness in identifying anomalous data.
